The ESP8266 modules are so cheap who could resist experimenting with one.  For about $8USD a few things you get are 9 GPIOs, I2C/SPI support, an ADC, and on board WiFi or other goodies.  In addition it's all programmable in the Arduino IDE that is familiar to many and has a good user support network.
